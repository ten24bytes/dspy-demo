### Recommended Adoption Path
1. Update dependencies: `uv sync`
2. Test existing code (should work unchanged)
3. Enable usage tracking: `configure_dspy(lm=lm, track_usage=True)`
4. Try one new feature (e.g., adapters or multimodal)
5. Optimize with GEPA when ready for production
6. Gradually adopt other features as needed
