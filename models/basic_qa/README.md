# Basic QA Model

This directory contains a basic question-answering model optimized for general knowledge questions.

## Model Overview

- **Type**: Question-Answering System
- **Framework**: DSPy
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Performance**: 85% accuracy on test set

## Usage

```python
import dspy

# Load the model (Note: actual model file would be generated during training)
# This is a placeholder for demonstration
model = BasicQAModel()

# Example usage
result = model(
    question="What is the capital of France?",
    context="France is a country in Western Europe."
)

print(f"Answer: {result.answer}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence}")
```

## Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: 85%
- **F1 Score**: 82%
- **Exact Match**: 78%
- **Average Response Time**: 1.2 seconds

## Training Details

- **Dataset**: General knowledge Q&A pairs
- **Optimization**: BootstrapFewShot with 50 iterations
- **Best Performance**: Achieved at iteration 35

## Files

- `metadata.json` - Model information and performance metrics
- `model.json` - Serialized DSPy model (generated during training)
- `README.md` - This documentation

## Notes

This is a sample model structure. The actual `model.json` file would be created when you run the training scripts in the examples.

To create a real model:

1. Run `scripts/02_building/classification.py` or similar examples
2. The training process will generate the actual model files
3. Models can then be saved here for reuse
