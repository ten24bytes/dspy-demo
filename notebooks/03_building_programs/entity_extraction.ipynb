        "7. **Evaluation Framework** - Measuring extraction performance against ground truth\n",
        "8. **Batch Processing** - Efficient processing of multiple documents\n",
        "9. **Output Formatting** - Structured JSON and CSV output formats\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advanced Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Chain of Thought Reasoning** - Explicit reasoning steps for complex extractions\n",

        "- **Content Analysis** - Understanding key entities in text content\n",
        "- **Data Enrichment** - Adding structured metadata to text data\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Fine-tuning** - Use DSPy optimizers to improve extraction accuracy\n",
